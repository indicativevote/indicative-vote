# indicative-vote
node version of the site

This repo auto deploys to https://indicativevote.herokuapp.com/

That is mapped to http://live.indicativevote.uk (I may need to pay Heroku to get https)

I then manually save the page into index.html in https://github.com/indicativevote/indicativevote.github.io

That repo auto deploys to https://indicativevote.github.io which is also https://indicativevote.uk/
